This repository contains software for estimating cell counts from limited dilution assays.

Simulations
-----------

The _simulation_ folder contains the R code for simulating such assays and plotting the results. Running these simulations trains intuition and provides the ground truth for testing of model implementations. The simulations currently implemented follow the protocol of the [QVOA assay](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/018911v1) to estimate the latent reservoir of replication competent HIV. The scripts depend on the [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) R package.

Quantal dilution assay analyses
-------------------------

Analysis software will be added as it is developed.
