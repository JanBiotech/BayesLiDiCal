Description: A Bayesian method to estimate the number of cells a particular type in a sample from quantal limited dilution assays. The read out consists of positive (if at least one cell of the desired type is present) or negative wells in a dilution series. The number of the focal cells is assumed small compared to the total pool in the samples.
